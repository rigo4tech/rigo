# Hey, Welcome!!

I am a Machine Learning (ML) Engineer with over 6+ years of experience in applied and fundamental ML research. I love to solve real-world problems using ML/LLMs. I am a generalist and have worked on projects employing LLMs, Graph Representation Learning, Self-Supervised learning, Reinforcement Learning, Recommendation Systems, and Time series prediction in both applied and research settings.
